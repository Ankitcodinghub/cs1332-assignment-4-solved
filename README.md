1. All submitted code must compile under JDK 8. This includes unused code, so don‚Äôt submit extra files that don‚Äôt compile. Any compile errors will result in a 0.

2. Do not include any package declarations in your classes.

3. Do not change any existing class headers, constructors, instance/global variables, or method signatures. For example, do not add throws to the method headers since they are not necessary.

4. Do not add additional public methods.

5. Do not use anything that would trivialize the assignment. (e.g. don‚Äôt import/use java.util.ArrayList for an ArrayList assignment. Ask if you are unsure.)

6. Always be very conscious of efficiency. Even if your method is to be O(n), traversing the structure multiple times is considered inefficient unless that is absolutely required (and that case is extremely rare).

7. You must submit your source code, the .java files, not the compiled .class files.

8. After you submit your files, redownload them and run them to make sure they are what you intended to submit. You are responsible if you submit the wrong files.

DoublyLinkedList

You are to code a non-circular DoublyLinkedList with head and tail references. A linked list is a collection of nodes, each having a data item and references to other nodes. In a DoublyLinkedList, each node has references to the previous and next nodes. The previous reference for the head/first node will point to null. The next reference for the tail/last node will point to null. Do not use a phantom node to represent the start or end of your list. A phantom or sentinel node is a node that does not store data held by the list and is used solely to indicate the start or end of a linked list. If your list contains n elements, then it should contain exactly n nodes.

The DoublyLinkedList must follow the requirements stated in the javadocs of each method you must implement. Your linked list implementation will use the default constructor (the one with no parameters) which is automatically provided by Java. Do not write your own constructor.

Nodes

The linked list consists of nodes. A class DoublyLinkedListNode is provided to you. DoublyLinkedListNode has getter and setter methods to access and mutate the structure of the nodes.

Traversing

You are able to traverse a DoublyLinkedList from both ends depending on which makes more sense. For example, if you know the index you want is close to the end of the list, you‚Äôd start traversing from the tail and go backwards; the opposite applies if the index is close to the beginning of the list. You should make this optimization wherever it applies.

Adding

You will implement three add() methods. One will add to the front, one will add to the back, and one will add to anywhere in the list given a specific index. See the javadocs for more details.

Removing

You will also implement three remove() methods ‚Äì from the front, the back, or anywhere in the list given a specific index. Make sure that there is no longer any way to access the removed node so that the node will be garbage collected. See the javadocs for more details.

Grading

Here is the grading breakdown for the assignment. There are various deductions not listed that are incurred when breaking the rules listed in this PDF and in other various circumstances.

Methods:

addAtIndex 10pts

addToFront 5pts

addToBack 5pts

removeAtIndex 10pts

removeFromFront 5pts

removeFromBack 5pts

get 10pts

isEmpty 4pts

clear 5pts

removeLastOccurrence 10pts

toArray 6pts

Other:

Checkstyle 10pts

Efficiency 15pts

Total: 100pts

JUnits

If you need help on running JUnits, there is a guide, available on Canvas under Files, to help you run JUnits on the command line or in IntelliJ.

Style and Formatting

Javadocs

Vulgar/Obscene Language

Any submission that contains profanity, vulgar, or obscene language will receive an automatic zero on the assignment. This policy applies not only to comments/javadocs, but also things like variable names. Exceptions

When throwing exceptions, you must include a message by passing in a String as a parameter. The message must be useful and tell the user what went wrong. ‚ÄúError‚Äù, ‚ÄúBAD THING HAPPENED‚Äù, and ‚Äúfail‚Äù are not good messages. The name of the exception itself is not a good message. For example:

Bad: throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException(‚Äò‚ÄòIndex is out of bounds.‚Äô‚Äô);

Good: throw new IllegalArgumentException(‚Äò‚ÄòCannot insert null data into data structure.‚Äô‚Äô);

Generics

If available, use the generic type of the class; do not use the raw type of the class. For example, use new LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt;() instead of new LinkedList(). Using the raw type of the class will result in a penalty.

Forbidden Statements

‚Ä¢ package

‚Ä¢ System.arraycopy()

‚Ä¢ clone()

‚Ä¢ assert()

‚Ä¢ Arrays class

‚Ä¢ Array class

‚Ä¢ Thread class

‚Ä¢ Collections class

‚Ä¢ Collection.toArray()

‚Ä¢ Reflection APIs

‚Ä¢ Inner or nested classes

‚Ä¢ Lambda Expressions

‚Ä¢ Method References (using the :: operator to obtain a reference to a method)

If you‚Äôre not sure on whether you can use something, and it‚Äôs not mentioned here or anywhere else in the homework files, just ask.

Debug print statements are fine, but nothing should be printed when we run your code. We expect clean runs ‚Äì printing to the console when we‚Äôre grading will result in a penalty. If you submit these, we will take off points.

Provided

The following file(s) have been provided to you. There are several, but we‚Äôve noted the ones to edit.

1. DoublyLinkedList.java

This is the class in which you will implement the DoublyLinkedList. Feel free to add private helper methods but do not add any new public methods, inner/nested classes, instance variables, or static variables.

2. DoublyLinkedListNode.java

This class represents a single node in the linked list. It encapsulates the data, and the previous and next references. Do not alter this file.

3. DoublyLinkedListStudentTest.java

This is the test class that contains a set of tests covering the basic operations on the DoublyLinkedList class. It is not intended to be exhaustive and does not guarantee any type of grade. Write your own tests to ensure you cover all edge cases.

Deliverables

You must submit all of the following file(s). Please make sure the filename(s) matches the filename(s) below, and that only the following file(s) are present. The only exception is that Canvas will automatically append a -n depending on the submission number to the file name. This is expected and will be handled by the TAs when grading as long as the file name before this add-on matches what is shown below. If you resubmit, be sure only one copy of the file is present in the submission. If there are multiple files, do not zip up the files before submitting; submit them all as separate files.

Once submitted, double check that it has uploaded properly on Canvas. To do this, download your uploaded files to a new folder, copy over the support files, recompile, and run. It is your sole responsibility to re-test your submission and discover editing oddities, upload issues, etc.
